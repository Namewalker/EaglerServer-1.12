Further found to work best with the Eaglercraft 1.12 Tuff Client.

## To make an eaglercraft 1.12 server, follow the instructions below:
Here is how you can setup a connection:
<br>
<br>
First, go to the top of the repo and click on Code > Codespaces > Create Codespace
<br>
Now you have your own free server instance to host eaglercraft. Next you need to run the setup commands:
<br>
<br>
Create a terminal tab and paste the following:<br>
<br>
enter the following: `cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar`
<br>
then, make a new tab and enter the following: `cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar`
<br>
Now go to the ports area and forward port `8081`.
<br>
Right click port and make port `8081` public.
<br>
Right click again, click open in browser, then copy the URL of the page.
<br>
Load up the client (Tuff Client recomended [See TuffClient.Readme] due to smooth running)! When you are in, paste the link in the add server section, replacing https:// with wss:// and join!
Your Eaglercraft server is setup!
<br>
PS: You can use this as a normal server too (like properly hosted) just clone this repo and run it in much the same way. I (Namewalker) have also added small plugins like a mini worldedit (/wand, /set, /replacenear) and a second plugin of my own design, but I'm not going to give too much away...
<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
