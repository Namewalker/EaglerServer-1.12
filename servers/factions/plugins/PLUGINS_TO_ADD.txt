Recommended plugins to add to `servers/factions/plugins/`:

- Factions (one of):
  - FactionsUUID (MassiveCraft) - compatible with older MC versions
  - FactionsX - community maintained alternative (check compatibility)
- Vault (for economy hook)
- Essentials (or EssentialsX) - homes, spawn, basic admin tools
- WorldGuard (optional) - region protection for special areas

Notes:
- Many Factions jars are distributed via SpigotMC and require manual download. Place the jar(s) here and restart the server.
- If you want me to try downloading and installing a specific Factions build automatically, tell me the exact URL to a release jar (or I can attempt common GitHub releases if available).
